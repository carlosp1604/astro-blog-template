We often think that SEO is just for the marketing team, but as developers, we have a huge impact on site visibility.

## Key Points

Here is a quick checklist for your development:

1.  **Meta Tags:** Ensure `title` and `description` are unique per page.
2.  **Semantic HTML:** Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` instead of just `<div>`.
3.  **Alt Attributes:** Never forget alternative text on your images.

## The Importance of Semantics

An `<h1>` should be the main title. Don't use it just to make text big; that's what CSS is for.
