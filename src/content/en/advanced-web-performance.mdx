Beyond minifying CSS and optimizing images, there are critical metrics that Google uses to rank your site: the **Core Web Vitals**.

## Main Metrics

* **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** How long it takes for the largest visible element to load.
* **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** How much the page moves while loading (visual stability).
* **FID (First Input Delay):** How long the page takes to react to the user's first interaction.

## Optimization Techniques

### Lazy Loading

Load images only when they enter the viewport. In modern HTML, it's as easy as:

```html
<img src="photo.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description" />
```
